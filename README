fallocate
=========

fallocate exposes an interface to fallocate(2), posix_fallocate(3) and posix_fadvise(3).

Under Mac OS X the fallocate() method will use the apple equivalent of fallocate(2).
Note that this might not be exactly the same.

When using the wrapper functions around the fallocate(2) call, this is the default, the
arguments given to the function are slightly different then the c call.

This module has the arguments like:

::

  fallocate(fd, offset, length, mode=0)

While in C the function looks like:

::

  fallocate(fd, mode, offset, length)

The main reason for this is that the mode argument tends not to be used much and thus
having the default as a keyword argument is much easier then having to specify 0 everytime.
